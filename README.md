## :rocket: About the project

I did this project to learn more about Google Data Studio and I always wanted to do something about League of Legends.

## :wrench: How it works?

The program takes the name, image, function, difficulty and about the character from the League of Legends website and inserts it all into a file, and presents it to Google Data Studio.

## :warning: Prerequisites

- You need to have chromedriver installed on the machine that is compatible with your Google Chrome version.

- pip install selenium
